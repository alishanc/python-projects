'''We use the below 'student variable in the for loop because:
In Python, when looping through a dictionary, the looped variable only returns the KEY
    and not the whole 'key: value' pair.
We can expect that the student variable will reference the KEY in the dictionary above
    i. e. Harry, Draco etc etc...
    When in doubt - PRINT
